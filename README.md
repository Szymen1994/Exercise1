# GistApp
 My first website made in react <img alt="SzymonWojcikGistWebsite" width="26px" src="https://camo.githubusercontent.com/48d099290b4cb2d7937bcd96e8497cf1845b54a810a6432c70cf944b60b40c77/68747470733a2f2f7261776769742e636f6d2f676f72616e67616a69632f72656163742d69636f6e732f6d61737465722f72656163742d69636f6e732e737667" />

 

 Website was made for first year of study to pass exam
 
tasks that the page had to fulfill were:
 - list gists
 - Add gists
 - Edit gists
 - Delete gists
 - Show private gists
 - Show public gists

 I still want to modify website and let people add their github token to make website work for everyone, not just for me.
